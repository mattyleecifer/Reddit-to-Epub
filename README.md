# Reddit-to-Epub
Changes any old.reddit.com link into an .epub file

I wanted unlimited content to listen to.

Basically this script will take an old.reddit.com link and then convert it to an epub file, as in the description.

It takes whatever link you have in your clipboard and will create the file out of that.

I then put the file into Google Play books on my phone and get it to read out loud. Unlimited content to listen to at work.

Very basic, but very useful for me.
